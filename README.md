SignGlove: Translating Gestures into Words

Overview

SignGlove is a wearable device designed to bridge the communication gap by translating sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time. This project aims to promote inclusivity and accessibility for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

Features

Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detects and translates hand gestures instantaneously.

Cross-Language Support: Customizable to recognize gestures from various sign languages.

Portable Design: Lightweight and ergonomic glove for daily use.

Open Source: Encourages contributions and enhancements from the community.

Project Goals

To enhance inclusivity and accessibility by enabling seamless communication between sign language users and non-signers.

Components and Technologies

Hardware

Flex Sensors: Measure the bending of fingers to capture gestures.

ADXL345 Accelerometer: Detects hand orientation and movement.

Arduino Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and facilitates communication with other devices.

Software

Programming Language: Arduino C++

Gesture Recognition Algorithms: Processes data from sensors to identify specific gestures.

Output Interfaces: Text display (LCD) or speech synthesis module for communication.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Hardware Components:

Flex sensors (5 for each finger)

ADXL345 accelerometer

Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno or Nano)

Connecting wires

Power supply

Software:

Arduino IDE

Necessary libraries for ADXL345 and other components (available in Arduino Library Manager)

Assembly

Attach flex sensors to each finger of the glove.

Connect the ADXL345 accelerometer to the Arduino using I2C.

Wire the output devices (e.g., LCD or speaker module) to the Arduino.

Secure all components to the glove using adhesive or stitching.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SignGlove.git

Open the project in Arduino IDE.

Install the required libraries via Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Usage

Wear the glove and ensure all connections are secure.

Power on the device.

Perform gestures; the glove will translate them to text displayed on the screen or output as speech.
